## R2 Why is it a problem that needs solving?

The absence of a centralized and automated investment management system presents several significant challenges for investors, highlighting the necessity for a solution like the described app. Without such a system, investors face the following problems:

#### Scattered Investment Data: 
Investors typically have assets across different accounts, platforms, or asset classes like stocks, bonds, and cryptocurrencies. This dispersion makes it difficult to get a unified view of their financial health, leading to disjointed decision-making and potential oversight of critical portfolio diversification or rebalancing opportunities.

#### Manual Portfolio Updates and Time Consumption: 
Tracking and updating portfolio holdings manually is not only tedious but also prone to errors. Each buy or sell transaction requires manual entry, and keeping tabs on the current market value of diverse assets can be overwhelmingly complex, consuming valuable time that could be better spent on strategic investment analysis.

#### Security and Privacy Concerns: 
Given the sensitive nature of financial data, there's a legitimate concern over the security and privacy of using third-party services. Investors need assurance that their data is protected against unauthorized access and breaches.

#### In summary:
The absence of an efficient investment management system complicates portfolio tracking, exposes investors to the risk of making decisions based on outdated information, and ultimately hampers their ability to achieve optimal financial outcomes. The app addresses these issues by offering a secure, real-time, and user-friendly platform for investors to manage their portfolios more effectively, making it a critical solution for anyone looking to optimize their investment strategy.

## R10 Describe the way tasks are allocated and tracked in your project

In the <b>Portfolio tracker API</b> project, task allocation and tracking are streamlined through the use of Trello, a project management tool that facilitates clear visualization of the project timeline and responsibilities. Here's how it's structured:

#### Trello Board Setup: 
I have set up a Trello board specifically for this project, divided into three lists that correspond to the three weeks of the project timeline. Each list represents a week, ensuring tasks are organized according to the timeframe in which they need to be completed.

#### Weekly Lists and Daily Cards: 
Within each weekly list, I have created cards that represent specific tasks or activities to be undertaken on particular days. These cards detail what needs to be done, and any relevant deadlines. This structure allows for a day-by-day breakdown of the project's progress.

#### Tracking Progress: 
Task's are sorted directly on Trello by using checklist's on cards with status's from "To Do" to "In Progress" and finally to "Done" as I complete their activities. This visual progression allows me to monitor the project's advancement in real-time and identify any areas that may require additional focus.

#### Adapting to Changes: 
Given the tight timeline, flexibility is crucial. The Trello board is reviewed and updated to reflect any changes in priorities or task allocations. This agile approach enables me to respond quickly to unforeseen challenges or adjustments in the project scope.

#### Summary:
By utilizing Trello in this structured yet flexible manner, I maintain a clear overview of the project's progress, ensure tasks are completed efficiently. This methodical approach to task alocation and tracking is instrumental in keeping the project on track within the constrained three-week timeframe.
